# Introduction to Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

In this tutorial, we will explore how to extend Kubernetes using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and build a custom Kubernetes controller using KubeBuilder. By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to create custom resources, manage them using controllers, and deploy them in a Kubernetes cluster.

Why do we need CRDs?

Kubernetes is designed to be extensible, allowing users to introduce new resource types using CRDs. This capability is crucial for implementing custom applications and services that can be managed like native Kubernetes resources.

## Objectives
- Understand the concept of CRDs in Kubernetes.
- Install KubeBuilder.
- Create and modify a custom controller.
- Test the custom controller.

Let's get started!
