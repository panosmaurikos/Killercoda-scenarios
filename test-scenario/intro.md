# Introduction to Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) allow Kubernetes users to extend the Kubernetes API by adding their own custom resources. This capability is essential for building Kubernetes operators and managing application-specific configurations.

In this tutorial, we will focus on creating a custom resource called `MyApp` and managing its lifecycle using KubeBuilder. We will cover the installation of KubeBuilder, modifying the controller logic, and testing our implementation.

## Objectives
- Understand the concept of CRDs in Kubernetes.
- Install KubeBuilder.
- Create and modify a custom controller.
- Test the custom controller.

Let's get started!
