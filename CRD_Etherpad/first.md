# Introduction to Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
In this tutorial, we’ll dive into how to extend Kubernetes with Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and develop a custom Kubernetes controller using KubeBuilder. By the end, you'll have a strong grasp of how to create and manage custom resources and deploy them within a Kubernetes cluster.

### Why Use CRDs?
Kubernetes is inherently extensible, enabling users to define new resource types via CRDs. This functionality is essential for implementing unique applications and services that integrate seamlessly with Kubernetes, allowing them to be managed like native resources.

### Objectives
Gain a solid understanding of CRDs in Kubernetes
Install and set up KubeBuilder
Create, configure, and deploy a custom controller
Test and verify the functionality of the controller
Let’s get started on building your first custom Kubernetes resource!
