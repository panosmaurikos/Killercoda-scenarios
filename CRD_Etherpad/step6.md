Now, let's modify the controller file (internal/controller/etherpadinstance_controller.go). This is the core of our operator’s functionality, as it contains the logic that manages the lifecycle of EtherpadInstance resources.

In this file, we implement the reconciliation loop, which continuously checks for changes in EtherpadInstance custom resources. Whenever a new resource is created or an existing one is modified, the controller takes action to ensure the Kubernetes environment matches the desired state specified in the custom resource.

Here, we’ll add code to:

Create or update Pods, Services, and any other resources needed for Etherpad to run.
Manage communication between Etherpad and its MySQL backend by setting up the necessary Services.
Handle resource deletion to clean up related resources when an EtherpadInstance is deleted.
With this modification, the controller will automatically manage EtherpadInstance resources and their dependencies in the cluster, ensuring that the application runs as specified.
