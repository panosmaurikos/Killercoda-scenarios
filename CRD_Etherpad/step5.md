Next, we modify the sample resource file (```config/samples/etherpad_v1alpha1_etherpadinstance.yaml```). This file provides an example of how to create an EtherpadInstance custom resource with specific configurations. By defining this sample, we can easily test and verify that our operator correctly handles EtherpadInstance resources.

In this file, we specify the desired settings for an EtherpadInstance, such as database connection details, storage options, and other configurations needed for the Etherpad application to run.
